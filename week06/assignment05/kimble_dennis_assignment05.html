	I had a difficult time with this assignment because from my perspective the hardest
	concepts of the course were all in this one assignment.  I am they type of learner
	that needs to focus on the concepts by first reading the book and then working through the individual
	examples until I get a full understanding of how things work. This assignment should really be
	three assignments building confidence with each one until all topics are covered. Throwing closures, tricky event handlers
	and canvas all in one gave me to many topics to consider which made it difficult for me to see a clear path
	of where to begin.  I have taught many journeyman in my thirty year career and I just don't feel like
	this is the proper way to teach complex topics.
	
	In the end I am unsure why my event handler is not seeing the node that is being passed to it but at this point it would
	not make a difference if I figured it out.
